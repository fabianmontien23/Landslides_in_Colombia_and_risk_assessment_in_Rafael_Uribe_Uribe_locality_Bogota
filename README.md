This repository contains a code for visualization of the registered landslides in Colombia from the Global Landslide Catalog, provided by NASA's Open Data Portal. The results displayed the distribution of registered landslides in Bogotá city. 
Furthermore, with the landslide hazard maps available in the open data source by the Bogotá's Institute for Risk Management and Climate Change (IDIGER), and the characterization of the exposed elements that I conducted in the study: "Landslide risk analysis and assessment in the Rafael Uribe Uribe locality, Bogotá, Colombia." The script executes a physical landslide risk assessment in the 1.024 exposed elements identified in the Rafael Uribe Uribe locality.
Lastly, the database with the characterization of the exposed elements is attached alongside the shapefiles I used to carry out the code and the list of abbreviations from the database’s fields, which were adapted from the original language into English.
